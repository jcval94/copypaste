# copypaste

The goal of copypaste is to accelate copyed data reading in R

## Installation

You can install the released version of copypaste from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("copypaste")
# or
remotes::install_git("https://git.rud.is/jcval94/copypaste.git")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

First, it is necessary to copy a table using Ctrl + C directly from your browser, excel, google sheets, etc.

```{r example}
library(copypaste)
## Not run
# copypaste()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
```{r datan,echo=FALSE}
new_df<-data.frame()
```


```{r data}
new_df
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# copypaste(header = FALSE)
new_df
```

Also you can use Addins to create a shortcut and be faster:
