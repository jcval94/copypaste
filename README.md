The goal of copypaste is to accelate copyed data reading in R

## Installation

You can install the released version of copypaste from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("copypaste")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

First, it is necessary to copy a table using Ctrl + C directly from your
browser, excel, google sheets, etc.

``` r
library(copypaste)
## Not run
# copypaste()
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
new_df
#> data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows
```

Youâ€™ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

    #> data frame with 0 columns and 0 rows

Also you can use Addins to create a shortcut and be faster:
